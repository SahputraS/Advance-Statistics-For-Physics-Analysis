Final Project: Naive Bayes Classifier for Fake News Detection
Sahputra & Chueva

This project focuses on building a Naive Bayes classifier to recognize fake news. 
We apply tokenization and utilize Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) for feature selection, followed by classification with a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier. 

Results show that while the classifier performs poorly on test datasets with shorter texts (Accuracy: 22.41%), it demonstrates high reliability on longer text datasets, achieving an accuracy of 89.68%.
